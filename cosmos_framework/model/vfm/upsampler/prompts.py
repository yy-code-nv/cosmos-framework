"""Canonical V4.2 upsampler prompt templates — inference-team entry point.

Standalone module. No file I/O, no non-stdlib imports. The canonical templates
for each task are inlined as Python string literals. To extend with a new
version, add an entry to ``CANONICAL_TEMPLATES`` keyed by ``(version, task)``.

_TEMPLATE_T2V_V4_2 = r"""<instructions>
You are a prompt upsampler for a text-to-video model. This instructions block defines the task and binds the output contract. The full input consists of this instructions block, a <video_description> scene description, a <task_constraints> numbered constraint list, and an <output_json_template> JSON schema. Produce exactly one fenced JSON object. The object fully populates every required field in the output template and strictly satisfies every numbered task constraint. The duration value specified in task constraint #4 is an upper bound for every timed field in the JSON, including the latest action end time and the final segment time_range; plan all timings within it.
</instructions>

<video_description>
{description}
</video_description>

<task_constraints>
1. **Scene imagination first.** Begin by writing `scene_imagination` first, before any other field, as ONE string containing ~6–12 short verb-led prompts (e.g., focus:, define:, refine:, visualize:, analyze:, clarify:). Keep it concise (prefer brevity over exhaustiveness) and under ~250 words. Use it to lock the concrete facts, style, camera intent, and timing plan; every other JSON field MUST be consistent with what you wrote here. (Operational note: at deployment, the inference team — not this upsampler — is responsible for stripping `scene_imagination` before the JSON is passed downstream.)

2. **Temporal caption second.** Immediately after `scene_imagination`, write `temporal_caption` as the second field. It is the canonical, timestamped visual playback timeline that downstream video generators consume to physicalize the clip. Walk the clip from t=0:00 to the `duration` (per #4) with timestamped beats placed where notable events occur (subject actions, camera motion, transitions, lighting/state changes, visual changes). Beat density must reflect how much actually happens: a busy clip will have many close-spaced beats; a slow contemplative clip will have a few sparse beats; a static shot may have only one beat at t=0:00 plus an ending observation. There is NO word limit — match the natural verbosity of the scene. Plan every other JSON field (subjects, actions, segments, etc.) to be consistent with the timeline you wrote here; in particular, `actions[].time` and `segments[].time_range` MUST agree with the beats you describe.

3. **Audio description third.** Immediately after `temporal_caption`, write `audio_description` as the third field. It is the parallel sonic timeline — dialogue, music, SFX, ambience — ideally aligned to the same beats with M:SS timestamps when audio events are time-localized (e.g. "soft ambient hum 0:00-0:03; sudden footstep at 0:04"). There is NO word limit — match the natural complexity of the scene's soundscape; if the clip is silent, write a brief description of why (e.g., "no audio track / silent footage").

4. **Output-parameter values (verbatim).** The following values are required to appear in the matching output JSON keys exactly as shown, and nowhere else; do not alter, normalize, round, infer, or relocate them:
   - duration: "{duration}"
   - fps: {fps}
   - aspect_ratio: "{aspect_ratio}"
   - resolution: {"W": {resolution_w}, "H": {resolution_h}}

5. **Duration is binding for time fields.** Treat the `duration` set in #4 as a hard ceiling for ALL timed content. Ensure `max(actions[].time.end)` ≤ `duration`, `max(segments[].time_range.end)` ≤ `duration`, and the latest beat in `temporal_caption` ≤ `duration`. Plan the schedule around this duration before filling actions/segments; after writing, re-check and truncate, shorten, or delete any item that would exceed the bound.

6. **Time format.** Use ONLY M:SS formatting for all time-bearing fields. `duration` must be exactly "M:SS" (e.g., "0:05"). Every `actions[].time` and `segments[].time_range` must be exactly "M:SS-M:SS" (e.g., "0:00-0:05"). Inside `temporal_caption` and `audio_description`, write timestamps in M:SS form (e.g., "At 0:03,…"). Never use "5s", never use milliseconds, and never use vague phase words like "beginning", "mid", "throughout".

7. **Internal consistency.** Make all fields mutually consistent and physically/visually coherent:
   - Maintain a logical temporal sequence across `temporal_caption`, `audio_description`, `actions`, and `segments`; no impossible overlaps unless explicitly intended and described.
   - Keep lighting, environment, wardrobe/props, mood, and color palette aligned across the whole JSON.
   - Ensure any lens/scale/perspective cues (e.g., wide vs telephoto, macro, aerial, POV) match stated framing, subject size, and placement.
   - Ensure `resolution.W`/`resolution.H` match the implied orientation and the (resolution_tier, aspect_ratio) dictated by #4.

8. **Faithfulness.** Do not contradict the provided video description. Every concrete described element (subjects, key actions, notable props, setting cues) must appear in the JSON, either directly or as a clearly plausible extension that does not change the core meaning.

9. **Scene coherence.** Add detail to increase richness, but only within the scene’s established logic and genre:
   - For realistic footage, obey physical plausibility (motion, lighting behavior, materials, causality).
   - For stylized/animated/sci-fi/fantasy/surreal scenes, prioritize internal stylistic rules and genre conventions over strict realism; additions must reinforce the chosen aesthetic.

10. **Schema completeness and density.** Output must strictly follow the template:
    - Include EVERY top-level key from the template exactly once; never invent extra keys.
    - Populate every field with specific, scene-justified detail; use empty values only when truly inapplicable.
    - The ONLY allowed empty values are exactly: `""`, `0`, `[]`, and `{}`. Do NOT use `null` anywhere.

11. **Output format.** Return ONLY a single JSON object wrapped inside a ```json code fence. Do not include prose, explanations, or any text outside the fence.

</instructions>

<image_description>
{description}
</image_description>

<task_constraints>
1. **Scene imagination first.** Begin by filling `scene_imagination` first, before any other field, as one single string made of short verb-led prompts (e.g., focus:, define:, refine:, visualize:, analyze:). Write ~6–12 prompts, prioritize brevity over exhaustiveness, and keep the total under ~250 words. Ensure every later field is consistent with what you wrote here. (Operational note: at deployment, the inference team — not this upsampler — is responsible for stripping `scene_imagination` before the JSON is passed downstream.)

2. **Comprehensive T2I caption — pinned 2nd, dense, downstream-actionable.** After `scene_imagination`, populate `comprehensive_t2i_caption` immediately (it MUST remain the 2nd top-level key in the output JSON). This text is the prompt consumed by the downstream image generator; all other JSON keys exist to support it.

- **Density**: 80–200 words, composed as a SINGLE tight paragraph (1–3 sentences). Not a one-line synopsis; not a list.

- **Integration**: merge EVERY concrete visual detail from the rest of the JSON — primary and secondary subjects (appearance, wardrobe, facial expression, pose), background_setting, lighting (conditions, direction, shadow behavior, illumination effects), aesthetics (composition, color palette, mood, patterns), cinematography (framing, camera angle, depth-of-field, focus, lens style), style_medium, artistic_style, plus any legible text/signage. Do not exclude any concrete item present in `subjects[]` or other populated fields.

- **Phrasing**: be immediate and literal. Start with the subject in the setting — NEVER begin with “this image shows,” “an image of,” “a picture of,” “depicting,” “we see,” or any meta-intro framing it as an image description.  
    DO  (good — begins with subject):  
        "A young woman in a crimson dress stands at the rim of a moonlit canyon..."  
    DON'T  (bad — meta-prefaced):  
        "This image shows a young woman in a crimson dress standing at the rim..."

- **Specificity**: use only visually-executable adjectives. Swap vague terms (“good lighting,” “nice composition”) for concrete directives (“warm late-afternoon golden light raking across...,” “rule-of-thirds with the subject anchored bottom-left”).

- **Consistency**: every stated element MUST be consistent with `subjects[]`, `background_setting`, `lighting`, `aesthetics`, `cinematography`, `style_medium`, `artistic_style`, and `text_and_signage_elements`. Do not add ungrounded details, and do not omit concrete details that are specified there.

3. **Output-parameter copy.** Copy these exact values into the matching output JSON keys, byte-for-byte:
   - aspect_ratio: "{aspect_ratio}"
   - resolution: {"W": {resolution_w}, "H": {resolution_h}}
   Do not modify, normalize, round, infer alternates, or relocate them. (T2I has no duration or fps — those are video-only.)

4. **Internal consistency.**
   - Keep lighting, setting, time-of-day, camera/framing, and mood mutually consistent (no contradictions such as “harsh noon sun” with “dim candlelit interior” unless explicitly justified).
   - Ensure `resolution.W` and `resolution.H` exactly match the (resolution_tier, aspect_ratio) pair implied by constraint #3; do not invent other sizes.

5. **Faithfulness.** Do not contradict the provided image description. Every concrete element mentioned (subjects, actions/poses, wardrobe, props, background features, environment, style cues) must appear in the JSON or be extended only in a way that is clearly plausible and non-conflicting.

6. **Scene coherence.** Add only details that fit the scene’s established logic and style:
   - For realistic scenes, additions should be physically plausible and context-appropriate.
   - For animation/sci‑fi/fantasy/surreal or other non-realistic genres, additions must follow that genre’s conventions and maintain a consistent visual language (do not “force realism” into a stylized world).

7. **Schema completeness and density.**
   - Include every top-level key from the template, and never add keys beyond the template.
   - Populate every field with specific, accurate, image-grounded detail; treat empties as a last resort.
   - The only permitted empty values are exactly: `""`, `0`, `[]`, `{}`. Do not use `null` anywhere.
   - If there is any human or humanoid subject, set `number_of_hands = 2` and `number_of_fingers = 10`; if all subjects are non-human, set both to 0.

8. **subject_details density (T2I-only).** Ensure the top-level `subject_details` dict is present and non-empty. Choose 2–5 image-specific attribute keys that best characterize THIS image, with concrete descriptive string values; vary the keys per image. Never output `{}`. Do not reuse any `subjects[].*` field names as `subject_details` keys (those belong inside per-subject objects).

9. **Output format.** Return ONLY the single JSON object, wrapped inside a ```json code fence. Do not include prose, explanations, comments, or any text outside the fence.

</instructions>

<image_description>
{description}
</image_description>

<task_constraints>
1. **SOURCE ANCHORING (highest priority).** Every concrete noun anywhere in your output — entity, material, color, count, named object, person attribute (gender, age, wardrobe, hair, skin, facial feature), on-screen or signage text, displayed number, brand, label — MUST already appear in <image_description>, either verbatim or as a direct unambiguous paraphrase. If <image_description> is silent on a property, your output must also be silent: leave the field empty or use the generic word the source used.

   The rule is categorical, not phrase-specific. Apply it to any input by recognizing the category. Pattern templates:
   - If source names an OBJECT generically (e.g. "the device", "a tool") without specifying material → do not invent a material in your output.
   - If source names a COUNT generically ("dozens", "several", "many") → keep the same generic word; do not pick a specific number ("over fifty", "twelve").
   - If source mentions a PERSON without an attribute (gender / age / hair / skin / wardrobe) → do not introduce that attribute. Use the same generic word the source used.
   - If source mentions a SIGN or SCREEN-TEXT without giving the exact text content → do not invent text content; describe the sign generically.
   - If source uses a precise PART-NAME or named component → reuse that exact phrase wherever you mention the thing.
   These templates illustrate the principle; the principle applies to any noun in any input.

2. **REWRITE-REFLEX SUPPRESSION.** Do NOT rewrite a source-anchored phrase into a different specific. If <image_description> already states a concrete noun, copy that noun verbatim wherever you mention the thing. Do NOT substitute a synonym, do NOT category-shift (e.g. "X" → "X-variant"), do NOT pick a more-specific subtype, do NOT replace the source phrase with an "elaborated" equivalent. Photographic descriptors (lens, lighting, framing) are NOT concrete nouns and may be added freely.

3. **CHAIN-LOCK across fields.** Every concrete noun in `comprehensive_t2i_caption`, in any `subjects[]` field, in `background_setting`, in `subject_details`, in `quadrant_scan`, in `text_and_signage_elements`, and in `context` MUST already appear in `scene_imagination` OR in <image_description>. New concrete nouns may NOT be introduced after scene_imagination is written. The only freely-added content across all fields is the photographic-descriptor class (see constraint #5).

4. **PERSON-ATTRIBUTE SILENCE (HARD RULE for human / humanoid subjects).** When <image_description> mentions a person without specifying an attribute, use these defaults — never invent:
   - `gender` = "Unknown" unless <image_description> uses an explicit gendered word
   - `age` = the exact age word <image_description> uses (or "Unknown" if no age word)
   - `clothing` = "" unless <image_description> mentions clothing
   - `skin_tone_and_texture` = "" unless <image_description> mentions skin
   - `facial_features` = "" unless <image_description> mentions a specific feature
   - `expression` = the exact word <image_description> uses (or "" if no expression word)
   This rule applies to every human/humanoid subject in `subjects[]`. Filling these slots from your training prior is forbidden when source is silent.

5. **PHOTOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTORS — freely add.** Only the following classes may be invented (because they describe HOW the image is captured, not WHAT is in it):
   - camera framing / angle / lens / focal length / depth of field
   - lighting quality / direction (only when source mentions or implies lighting)
   - composition (rule-of-thirds, leading lines, symmetry, negative space)
   - rendering style (photoreal / illustration / cartoon — only when source implies)
   - atmospheric quality (haze, contrast, mood, color palette)
   - generic shadow / reflection / specular behavior

6. **Order of generation.** First fill `scene_imagination` (verb-led scratchpad, 6-12 prompts, ~250 words max) using source-anchored vocabulary. Then fill `comprehensive_t2i_caption` (one tight paragraph, 80-200 words) reusing scene_imagination's concrete vocabulary verbatim — only adding photographic descriptors. Then fill the remaining structured fields (subjects[], background_setting, etc.), all of which inherit vocabulary from constraint #3.

7. **Output-parameter copy.** Copy these values byte-for-byte:
   - aspect_ratio: "{aspect_ratio}"
   - resolution: {"W": {resolution_w}, "H": {resolution_h}}

8. **Internal consistency.** Lighting / setting / time-of-day / framing / mood must be mutually consistent.

9. **Schema completeness.** Include every top-level key from the template; never add keys; never omit keys. Permitted empties: "", 0, [], {}. No null. If any subject is human/humanoid: number_of_hands=2, number_of_fingers=10. If all non-human: both = 0.

10. **subject_details density.** `subject_details` non-empty with 2-5 source-anchored attribute keys. Never `{}`.

11. **Output format.** ONLY one JSON object inside a ```json code fence. No prose outside.

_TEMPLATE_T2I_V4_2_EXPRESSIVE = r"""<instructions>
You are a prompt upsampler for a text-to-image model. Your job is to UPSAMPLE — take a sparse natural-language request and expand it into a rich, dense, structured JSON description of the target image. This instructions block governs the response. Next come an <image_description> scene description, a <task_constraints> numbered constraint list, and an <output_json_template> JSON schema. Produce exactly one fenced JSON object that fully populates every top-level key, satisfies every numbered task constraint, and is internally consistent with the request.

The output is always DENSE. Even when the request is brief, infer plausible, scene-consistent details for every field. Do not leave fields empty merely because the request did not mention them — the purpose of upsampling is to turn a sparse request into a complete, image-ready annotation. Be creative but stay grounded: additions must be physically plausible and internally consistent with the request's setting, subjects, mood, and context.
</instructions>

<image_description>
{description}
</image_description>

<task_constraints>
1. **Scene imagination first.** Begin by filling `scene_imagination` first, before any other field, as one single string made of short verb-led prompts (e.g., focus:, define:, refine:, visualize:, analyze:). Write ~6-12 prompts, under ~250 words total. Use this as your scratchpad for the whole scene: focus the main subject, define key elements, refine details, visualize lighting/camera/atmosphere, analyze coherence. Every later field must be consistent with what you wrote here. (Operational note: at deployment, the inference team strips `scene_imagination` before the JSON is passed downstream.)

2. **Comprehensive T2I caption — pinned 2nd, dense, downstream-actionable.** After `scene_imagination`, populate `comprehensive_t2i_caption` immediately (MUST remain the 2nd top-level key). This is the natural-language prose passed to the downstream image generator; all other JSON keys exist to support it.

   - **Density**: 80-200 words as a SINGLE tight paragraph (1-3 sentences). Not a one-line synopsis; not a list.
   - **Integration**: merge EVERY concrete detail from the structured fields you populate below — primary and secondary subjects (appearance, wardrobe, expression, pose), background_setting, lighting (conditions, direction, shadow behavior, illumination effect), aesthetics (composition, palette, mood, patterns), cinematography (framing, angle, depth-of-field, focus, lens), style_medium, artistic_style, and any visible text/signage. Do not exclude any concrete item present in `subjects[]` or other populated fields.
   - **Phrasing**: be immediate and literal. Start with the subject in the setting — NEVER begin with "this image shows", "an image of", "a picture of", "depicting", "we see", or any meta-intro.
     DO  : "A young woman in a crimson dress stands at the rim of a moonlit canyon..."
     DON'T: "This image shows a young woman in a crimson dress standing at the rim..."
   - **Specificity**: use visually-executable adjectives. Swap vague terms ("good lighting") for concrete directives ("warm late-afternoon golden light raking across...").

3. **Output-parameter copy.** Copy these exact values into the matching output JSON keys, byte-for-byte:
   - aspect_ratio: "{aspect_ratio}"
   - resolution: {"W": {resolution_w}, "H": {resolution_h}}
   Do not modify, normalize, or relocate them. (T2I has no duration or fps.)

4. **Internal consistency.** Lighting / setting / time-of-day / camera / framing / mood must be mutually consistent. No contradictions (e.g. "harsh noon sun" with "dim candlelit interior" unless justified).

5. **Faithfulness.** Do not contradict the provided image description. Every concrete element it mentions (subjects, actions/poses, wardrobe, props, background features, environment, style cues) must appear in the JSON or be extended in a way that is clearly plausible and non-conflicting.

6. **EXPRESSIVE DENSITY (highest priority for empties).** The purpose of the upsampler is to FILL the structured annotation, not echo it. Even when the request is brief, infer plausible details for every field consistent with the request's scene, subjects, and mood. Be creative but stay grounded:
   - Additions must be physically plausible and internally consistent.
   - For realistic scenes, additions are physically plausible and context-appropriate.
   - For animation/sci-fi/fantasy/surreal, additions follow that genre's conventions and visual language.
   - Inferences must support the comprehensive_t2i_caption — not contradict source, not introduce conflicting elements.

7. **Schema completeness and permitted empties.** Include every top-level key from the template exactly once. Never add keys beyond the template. Populate every field with specific, image-grounded detail. Empty values are permitted ONLY for truly inapplicable fields:
   - Human-only subject fields (clothing, expression, gender, age, skin_tone_and_texture, facial_features, number_of_arms, number_of_legs, number_of_hands, number_of_fingers) when the subject is non-human.
   - `text_and_signage_elements = []` when no visible text or signage is present.
   - `aesthetics.patterns = ""` when there are no notable repeating patterns.
   - `subject_details = {}` when no image-specific structured attributes apply.
   The only permitted empty literals are exactly: `""`, `0`, `[]`, `{}`. Do not use `null`.
   - If any subject is human/humanoid: set `number_of_hands = 2` and `number_of_fingers = 10`. If all subjects are non-human, set both to 0.

8. **subject_details density (T2I-only).** Top-level `subject_details` dict is present and non-empty: 2-5 image-specific attribute keys with concrete descriptive string values (e.g. `"hairstyle": "wavy auburn shoulder-length"`, `"footwear": "tan leather Chelsea boots"`, `"hand_props": "antique brass pocket watch in right hand"`). Vary keys per image; never reuse `subjects[].*` field names; never output `{}` when at least one human/humanoid subject is present.

9. **Output format.** Return ONLY the single JSON object, wrapped inside a ```json code fence. No prose, explanations, comments, or text outside the fence.

_TEMPLATE_I2V_V4_2 = r"""<instructions>
Your function is to operate as a prompt upsampler for an image-to-video model. You will be provided with several inputs: (a) an attached starting frame image, which serves as the definitive visual ground truth for subjects, setting, lighting, and color palette; (b) this instruction block; (c) a <video_description> detailing the scene's temporal and action-based intent; (d) a numbered <task_constraints> list; and (e) an <output_json_template> schema. Your sole output is one fenced JSON object. This object must populate every required field from the template and meticulously satisfy every numbered task constraint. Fields pertaining to visual information (`subjects`, `background_setting`, `lighting`, `aesthetics`, `style_medium`, `artistic_style`) must be entirely consistent with the attached image and must not contradict it. Fields pertaining to temporal information (`actions`, `segments`, `transitions`, `temporal_caption`) should be derived from the <video_description>, allowing for plausible extrapolation of events beyond the static first frame. The duration value from task constraint #2 establishes a strict upper limit for all time-based values in the JSON, which includes the latest action end time and the closing `time_range` of the final segment; all scheduling must occur within this duration.

</instructions>

<video_description>
{description}
</video_description>

<task_constraints>
1. **Scene imagination first.** Begin by writing `scene_imagination` first, before any other field, as ONE string containing ~6–12 short verb-led prompts (e.g., focus:, define:, refine:, visualize:, analyze:, clarify:). Keep it concise (prefer brevity over exhaustiveness) and under ~250 words. Use it to lock the concrete facts, style, camera intent, and timing plan; every other JSON field MUST be consistent with what you wrote here. Anchor the visual facts (subjects' appearance, setting, lighting, palette) on the attached starting frame; anchor the temporal facts (action sequence, segment timeline, transitions) on the video_description. (Operational note: at deployment, the inference team — not this upsampler — is responsible for stripping `scene_imagination` before the JSON is passed downstream.)

2. **Output-parameter copy.** Copy these exact values into the matching output JSON keys and nowhere else; do not alter, normalize, round, infer, or relocate them:
   - duration: "{duration}"
   - fps: {fps}
   - aspect_ratio: "{aspect_ratio}"
   - resolution: {"W": {resolution_w}, "H": {resolution_h}}

3. **Duration is binding for time fields.** Treat the `duration` copied in #2 as a hard ceiling for ALL timed content. Ensure `max(actions[].time.end)` ≤ `duration` and `max(segments[].time_range.end)` ≤ `duration`. Plan the schedule around this duration before filling actions/segments; after writing, re-check and truncate, shorten, or delete any item that would exceed the bound.

4. **Time format.** Use ONLY M:SS formatting for all time-bearing fields. `duration` must be exactly "M:SS" (e.g., "0:05"). Every `actions[].time` and `segments[].time_range` must be exactly "M:SS-M:SS" (e.g., "0:00-0:05"). Never use "5s", never use milliseconds, and never use vague phase words like "beginning", "mid", "throughout".

5. **Internal consistency.** Make all fields mutually consistent and physically/visually coherent:
   - Maintain a logical temporal sequence across actions and segments; no impossible overlaps unless explicitly intended and described.
   - Keep lighting, environment, wardrobe/props, mood, and color palette aligned across the whole JSON, anchored on what is visible in the attached starting frame.
   - Ensure any lens/scale/perspective cues (e.g., wide vs telephoto, macro, aerial, POV) match stated framing, subject size, and placement, consistent with the attached frame.
   - Ensure `resolution.W`/`resolution.H` match the implied orientation and the (resolution_tier, aspect_ratio) dictated by #2.

6. **Faithfulness to BOTH image and description.** Do not contradict either input. Every concrete element visible in the attached starting frame (subjects, their appearance, setting, lighting, colors, framing) MUST appear in the JSON. Every concrete described element in the video_description (key actions, notable temporal beats, mentioned props) MUST also appear. When the description is ambiguous on a visual field, defer to the image; when the image cannot answer a temporal question, defer to the description.

7. **Visual fidelity to the attached frame.** The attached image is the FIRST FRAME of the video; the video starts here. The first segment (`segments[0]`) and the earliest actions must depict the scene as shown in the image — same subjects in the same configuration, same setting, same lighting, same color palette. Subsequent segments may evolve naturally; the scene at t=0 must match the image.

8. **Scene coherence.** Add detail to increase richness, but only within the scene's established logic and genre:
   - For realistic footage, obey physical plausibility (motion, lighting behavior, materials, causality).
   - For stylized/animated/sci-fi/fantasy/surreal scenes, prioritize internal stylistic rules and genre conventions over strict realism; additions must reinforce the chosen aesthetic established by the image.

9. **Schema completeness and density.** Output must strictly follow the template:
   - Include EVERY top-level key from the template exactly once; never invent extra keys.
   - Populate every field with specific, scene-justified detail; use empty values only when truly inapplicable.
   - The ONLY allowed empty values are exactly: `""`, `0`, `[]`, and `{}`. Do NOT use `null` anywhere.

10. **Output format.** Return ONLY a single JSON object wrapped inside a ```json code fence. Do not include prose, explanations, or any text outside the fence.

You are a prompt upsampler for a transfer-conditioned image/video generation model. This instructions block defines the task and binds the output contract. The full input consists of this instructions block, attached transfer-conditioning media, a <video_description> scene description, a <task_constraints> numbered constraint list, and an <output_json_template> JSON schema.

The attached media are supplied by the caller before this text:
- For transfer_mode="t2v": attached control video(s), then this text prompt.
- For transfer_mode="i2v": attached starting frame image, attached control video(s), then this text prompt.
- For transfer_mode="v2v": attached source-video opening clip, attached control video(s), then this text prompt.

{transfer_instruction}

Produce exactly one JSON object. The object must fully populate every required field in the output template and strictly satisfy every numbered task constraint. The output JSON describes the target video in dense structured form, consistent with both the text description and attached transfer-conditioning media.
</instructions>

<video_description>
{description}
</video_description>

<task_constraints>
1. **Transfer conditioning.** Use the attached control video(s) as structural and motion guidance. The output JSON must be consistent with the visible layout, geometry, subject placement, motion boundaries, and temporal evolution implied by the control video(s).

2. **Mode grounding.**
   - For transfer_mode="t2v", rely on the text description plus control video(s).
   - For transfer_mode="i2v", keep the attached starting frame as the visual anchor for subjects, setting, composition, lighting, and style.
   - For transfer_mode="v2v", keep the attached source-video opening clip as the visual anchor for the beginning of the generated video, including subject identity, scene layout, camera style, and initial motion.

3. **Control consistency.** Do not invent major geometry, object placements, camera motion, or subject movements that conflict with the attached control video(s). If multiple controls are attached, satisfy all of them as much as possible:
   - edge constrains outlines and object boundaries.
   - blur constrains coarse appearance and low-frequency layout.
   - depth constrains 3D structure, distance, and foreground/background layout.
   - seg constrains object/region identity and spatial grouping.
   - world_scenario constrains AV scene layout and world-state semantics.

4. **Faithfulness.** Do not contradict the provided video description or attached media. Every concrete described element, including subjects, key actions, props, setting cues, camera cues, and visible text, must appear in the JSON either directly or as a clearly plausible extension that does not change the core meaning.

5. **Dense JSON, not a short caption.** Expand the prompt into a complete structured annotation. Add rich scene detail when helpful, but keep additions physically plausible and grounded in the description and conditioning media.

6. **Temporal consistency.** Make `actions`, `segments`, subject `action`, subject `state_changes`, and `cinematography.camera_motion` agree with each other. Use M:SS-M:SS time ranges for `actions[].time` and `segments[].time_range`.

7. **Schema completeness.** Include every top-level key from the template exactly once. Do not invent extra top-level keys. Populate every field with specific, scene-justified detail. Use empty values only when truly inapplicable.

8. **Allowed empty values.** The only allowed empty values are exactly: "", 0, [], and {}. Do not use null.

9. **Output format.** Return only a single JSON object. Do not include prose, explanations, markdown headings, or any text outside the JSON.

def is_upsampled_prompt(prompt: str) -> bool:
    """Heuristic: return ``True`` iff ``prompt`` looks like the V4.2
    upsampler's emitted output and therefore should NOT be fed through
    the native upsampler again.

    Used by inference callers (e.g.
    ``cosmos3.inference.OmniInference._iter_predictions``) to decide
    per-batch whether to pass a native prompt-upsample task to
    :meth:`OmniMoTModel.generate_samples_from_batch`.  Two motivating
    cases produce already-upsampled prompts:

    1. The user (or an upstream pipeline) supplies a pre-upsampled
       caption directly as ``sample_args.prompt`` — typically the
       fenced ``\\`\\`\\`json {...} \\`\\`\\``` output of an earlier
       upsampler run that they want to reuse verbatim.
    2. The external endpoint path
       (``OmniSampleOverrides._apply_prompt_upsampling_local`` in
       ``packages/cosmos3/cosmos3/args.py``) has already replaced
       ``self.prompt`` with the endpoint's JSON output before
       ``generate_samples_from_batch`` runs; the native upsampler must
       not double-process that.

    Recognised shapes (after leading/trailing whitespace strip):

      - Fenced JSON:  ``\\`\\`\\`json ... \\`\\`\\```  (also accepts the
        ``\\`\\`\\`\\n{`` shorthand some backends emit when the
        language tag is omitted).
      - Bare JSON object: first non-whitespace char is ``{`` AND the
        whole string parses as a JSON dict via ``json.loads``.

    Everything else returns ``False`` and falls through to native
    upsampling: plain prose, empty / whitespace-only strings, JSON
    arrays / scalars (numbers, strings, booleans), malformed JSON, and
    fenced non-JSON blocks (``\\`\\`\\`python``, etc.).  The function
    is intentionally conservative — false negatives are safe (we just
    redundantly upsample), while false positives would silently skip
    needed upsampling.  Never raises.

    Args:
        prompt: candidate caption string.  ``None`` is tolerated for
            caller convenience and treated as ``""``.

    Returns:
        ``True`` iff the prompt looks like an already-upsampled
        V4.2 payload that should be passed through unchanged.
